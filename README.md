markdown-enml
=============

Convert Markdown into Evernote's ENML

I am a heavy [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com) user, and I love writing in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). I want to write Markdown in my favorite editor. But once I've written something, I want to render it so it shows up nicely in Evernote. Since I both write and use Evernote on multiple platforms, I need something that will work nearly anywhere.

Bidirectional transformation (ie enml -> markdown) will be a bonus, if I can do it reliably.

## Constraints

 * I want something that will work inside of [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/), an excellent Markdown editor for iOS which can also run Python code to do stuff to your text. That means markdown-enml will have to work on Python 2.7.
 * Yes I know we should all move on from Python 2.x to Python 3.x, so this should work with Python 3 as well.
 * Python is portable, so this should work on Windows, OS X, and Linux as well.

## Usage
